# cub3d - a 3D game inspired by Wolfenstein

## Description

A 42 project that introduced us to 3D graphics programming using Raycasting. We created a simple 3D game with C and MiniLibX. This was a 42 team project by ashojach & amaucher.

## Installation

Simply run make to create the executable.

## Usage

Run the executable with the provided map: <./cub3D map.cub>
You can walk freely within the walls of the map. Use the keys W/S/A/D to move around. By pressing 'M' you can activate a minimap that will show you your position at any moment within the map.
